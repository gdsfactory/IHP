# IHP GDSFactory PDK 0.0.1

This repository contains a PDK (Process Design Kit) for the IHP CMOS technology, built using GDSFactory. It includes standard cell libraries, design rules, and example designs to facilitate the development of integrated circuits using this technology.

One of the advantages of using GDSFactory for PDK development is its modular and flexible approach to layout design. GDSFactory allows for easy creation and manipulation of layout components, making it straightforward to build and customize standard cells and other layout elements.


Advantages of using GDSFactory for PDK development:

- Programmatic layout generation: GDSFactory enables the creation of layout components using Python code, allowing for automation and easy modifications.
- Team collaboration: GDSFactory's code-based approach facilitates version control and collaboration among team members.
- Reproducibility: Designs can be easily reproduced and shared, ensuring that others can replicate the results.
- Modular design: Layout components can be reused and combined to create complex designs, promoting consistency and reducing errors.
